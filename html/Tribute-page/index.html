            <p id="tribute-info">
              Chadwick Aaron Boseman was an American actor and playwright who
              became a highly respected movie star with several iconic roles
              particularly in Black Panther (2018), and for his starring roles

              James Brown in Get on Up (2014), and Thurgood Marshall in Marshall
              (2017).<br />
              He also had choice parts in The Express (2008), Draft Day (2014),
              and Message from the King (2016). <br /><br />He was born on the
              29th of November 1976 and raised in Anderson, S.C., by his mother,
              Carolyn, who worked as a nurse, and father, Leroy, who worked in a
              textile factory.He was born the youngest of three boys. He
              attended Howard University and studied acting at the Oxford
              Mid-Summer Program before moving to Los Angeles in 2008 to pursue
              his craft on the big screen. <br />

              <br />
              <br />In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with the stage III colon
              cancer and he died on Friday the 28th of August 2020 as a result
              of complications related to colon cancer. He was 43. Although

              statement, he worked through his treatment for most of his career
              years. During treatment, involving multiple surgeries and
              chemotherapy, he continued to work and completed production for
              several films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, Ma Rainey, and

              <blockquote>
                  <p>"As a fan of Chadwick aptly put it;
                   Boseman was a beacon of light  to people across the globe. His role in Black Panther was
                    ground-breaking and iconic. For many black children, he was 
                  the first major superhero they could identify with. Rest in power to a genuine, virtuous hero.
